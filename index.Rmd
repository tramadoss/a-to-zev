The following map shows how many millionaires would be taxed under this proposition & the subsequent income that would be raised in 2020 USD.

```{r echo = FALSE, results = FALSE, warning = FALSE,message =-FALSE}
source("income_map.R")
```

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
m
```

How do we calculate these numbers?

The [American Community Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs) reports how many people make over $200,000 annually by where they live. Using information from California's tax board, we can distribute the number of people making over \$2 million annually & the amount of money they would pay proportionally to each community.
